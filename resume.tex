\section{\faUsers\quad Publications}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Photoacoustic Tomography Reconstruction with Score-based Diffusion Models}}{}
\textit{IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, IF 10.6, Under Review}
\role{Co-first Author}{Colaborated with Dr.~Hengrong Lan, Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University}
Reconstructing photoacoustic tomography images with score-based diffusion models.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Trained with only ground truth images, our method achieved competitive performance against supervised U-Net, while ours has higher generalization capability;
  \item A constraint is designed following the rotation equivariance between PAT measurements and images, which is used to guide the Langevin sampling process;
  \item Our method achieved 35.06 PSNR, 0.913 SSIM in uniform sampling with 32 measurements; and 29.69 PSNR, 0.823 SSIM in limited view with 32 measurements (128 in total).
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Review of Deep Learning Applications in Photoacoustic Imaging}}{}
\textit{Journal of Biomedical Optics, IF 3.5, Under Review}
\role{Co-first Author}{Colaborated with Hybrid Imaging System Laboratory, ShanghaiTech University}
A brief review of deep learning applications in photoacoustic imaging among recent years.

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Assessing the Mortality Risk of Critically Ill Patients with Deep Learning}}{}
\textit{Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine, IF 2.7}
\role{Co-first Author}{Colaborated with Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University}
The aim of this study was to assess the mortality risk of critically ill patients at risk of hypoperfusion in a prospective cohort by infrared thermography combined with deep learning methods.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compared the classification capability of several widely used vision backbones;
  \item Combined conventional cross-entropy loss with focal loss and label smoothing, which further improved the performance on the imbanlanced dataset.
\end{itemize}
