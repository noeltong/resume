\datedsubsection{\textbf{PAT Reconstruction with Score-based Diffusion Models}}{TMI 2023, Under Review}
\role{Co-first Author}{Cooperated with Dr.~Hengrong Lan, Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University}
Reconstructing photoacoustic tomography images with score-based diffusion models.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Trained with only gray ground truth images, our method achieved competitive performance against supervised U-Net, while ours has higher generalization capability;
  \item A constraint is designed following the rotation equivariance between PAT measurements and images, which is used to guide the Langevin sampling process;
  \item Our method achieved 35.06 PSNR, 0.913 SSIM in uniform sampling with 32 measurements; and 29.69 PSNR, 0.823 SSIM in limited view with 32 measurements (128 in total).
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Assessing the Mortality Risk of Critically Ill Patients with Deep Learning}}{RCM 2023}
\role{Co-first Author}{Cooperated with Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University}
The aim of this study was to assess the mortality risk of critically ill patients at risk of hypoperfusion in a prospective cohort by infrared thermography combined with deep learning methods.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compared the classification capability of several widely used vision backbones;
  \item Combined conventional cross-entropy loss with focal loss and label smoothing, which further improved the performance on the imbanlanced dataset.
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Classification of Benign and Malignant Colorectal Tissue with AR-PAM}}{IUS 2022, Oral}
\role{Co-first Author}{Cooperated with the First Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital}
Classifying the benign and malignant tissues using wavelet transform of the PAM signals.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Signals of cancer, polyp and normal tissues were obtained by scanning the \textit{ex-vivo} colorectal samples;
  \item Classify the cancer and normal regions with wavelet transform.
\end{itemize}
